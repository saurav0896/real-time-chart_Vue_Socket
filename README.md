# realtime-chart
This code demonstrate real time data on chart using VueJs as Front-End and NodeJS as backend. For chart I have used Echarts which is free and easy to integrate with VueJS.
This chart shows real data with time interval of 2 sec . And to remove loading issue , used socket.io which builds tunnel between server and client and provide data without any refresh.
